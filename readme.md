# Description

This is a university project done by me, which covers the following scope:
- division of dataset into train and validation set
- single-layer neural network trained on Adult dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) with a binary target variable 
- simulation for hyperparameter tuning which prints estimated time left (simulation runs ~4h)
- assessment of the model quality using the classifiers: confusion matrix, accuracy and field under ROC curve
